Classes for "Bulls and Cows" C# Console Game (Console-Focused Architecture)

1. GameManager
- Manages the entire flow of the game
- Initializes new game session
- Calls methods from ConsoleUI to interact with the user
- Tracks number of guesses and checks win/lose state

2. GameState (wrapper of logic)
- Holds the computer's secret code
- Holds the list of previous user guesses
- Checks if the guess is correct
- Calculates V/X feedback for guesses
- Pure logic only — no Console printing here

3. Guess - GUY - finished
- Represents a single guess attempt by the user
- Contains guessed letters and feedback result (V/X)
- Handles comparison to the secret code

4. SecretWordGenerator - #ROY#
- Creates a 4-letter secret code (A–H, no duplicates)
- Uses System.Random internally

5. InputValidator - GUY - finished
- Validates if user input is valid:
  - Exactly 4 characters
  - All between A–H
  - No duplicates

6. ConsoleUI - #ROY#
- Handles all input/output with the user
- Shows the board based on data from GameState
- Gets user guesses
- Displays messages like victory/defeat/invalid input
- Clears screen using Ex02.ConsoleUtils.Screen.Clear()

Notes:
- GameState, Guess, SecretWordGenerator, and InputValidator contain no Console.Read/Write
- ConsoleUI is the only class with Console interactions
- GameManager bridges between ConsoleUI and the game logic
